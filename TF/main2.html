            <p class="one"> My name is Sarah Hamar and I am born and raised from the Buffalo area. I l moved back to the 716
                a few
                years ago and now reside in South Buffalo with my husband, Rob and our two kids, Declan and Scarlett.
                From a young age I have competed in travel/ elite athletics, specifically ice hockey and dance. During
                my high school years is when I was first introduced to dry land conditioning and working out. When I was
                a kid I did not understand the importance but looking back I realized that my love for fitness started
                to develop. When I was getting ready to go to college I hired my first personal trainer and I learned so
                much going into my freshman year. I went to SUNY Oswego where I was a Division III Women's Ice Hockey,
                Lacrosse and Rugby player. During my time there I spent the majority of my days perfecting my sport. But
                college ended as did competitive athletics.</p>

                I continued to implement fitness into my everyday life but it just didn't feel the same. A few years of
                this went on and I moved around, got married and had my son! Literally all in a few years. After having
                my baby I couldn't wait to get back in the gym! When I was able to lift again I went in full force and
                started to see really amazing changes in my physique and I decided to prep for a bikini competition. I
                competed in two shows 16 months after giving birth and won second in my first and first place in my
                second show and the rest is just history. I haven't stopped learning and focusing on my health and
                wellness since! </p>
